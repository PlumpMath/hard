hard.core
====

for ```arcadia -b develop``` and Unity 5

--news--
hard.tween has been depreciated in favore of [tween.core](https://github.com/selfsame/tween)


* hard.core
standard interops, Unity predicate fns, casting fns (```->go ->v3 ->vec```), overloaded operators, Vector3 opbindings, ```clone! clear-cloned destroy! resource```, etc. Worth a read if you're learning how to work with arcadia!


* hard.input
```key-down?  key?  key-up? mouse-down? mouse-up? mouse? mouse-pos mouse-ray ray-hit```

* hard.edit
```active sel hide! no-edit!```, also some gizmo stuff

## other

* hard.hooks
components for calling clojure ns/fn's via strings.  Meant to avoid non-generic ```defcomponent```s

* hard.spatial
spatial data structures live here

* hard.animation
animation utilities

* hard.mesh
mesh utilities

* hard.boiled
experimental ns
